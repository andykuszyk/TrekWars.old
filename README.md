# TrekWars

## About
TrekWars is intended to be a simple, fun coding project in Java. It utilises the jMonkeyEngine game engine and the idea is that it can be deployed across mobile and desktop platforms.

## Concept
The concept of the game is simple:
* Choose a race/side to play;
* Choose whether to defend or attack;
* Choose a race/side to battle against;
* Choose the environment to attack/defend;
* Battle!

## Getting started
To get started, just install the jMonkeyEngine and then clone this repo. From there, it should be a case of building the project and running the app.

## Notes on units
* Throughout the code, the "tpf" value from jMonkeyEngine is used. This is the time per frame in float seconds;
* Where units are referred to, they always in metres;
    * E.g. acceleration = 1 means 1 metre per second.
