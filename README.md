# TrekWars

## About
TrekWars is intended to be a simple, fun coding project in Java. It utilises the jMonkeyEngine game engine and the idea is that it can be deployed across mobile and desktop platforms.

## Concept
The concept of the game is simple:
* Choose a race/side to play;
* Choose whether to defend or attack;
* Choose a race/side to battle against;
* Choose the environment to attack/defend;
* Battle!

## Getting started
To get started, just install the jMonkeyEngine and then clone this repo. From there, it should be a case of building the project and running the app.
